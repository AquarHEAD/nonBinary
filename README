Nothing in our lives can be determined as good or bad, 
right or wrong, because life is so complex, our feelings 
are so complex.

Life is not binary, but mixed with sadness and happiness.

So, this is what I mean, nonBinary is a project for a blog 
system based on Python/Django, it's a spare-time project by 
me, a student at Zhejiang University. But I want to finish it 
as soon as possible.

Some principles: KISS, DRY and Always BETA.

That's all, and I hope someone would learn Django with me.
:D
